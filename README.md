# Some-Useful-Data-in-JSON-Format
Want a JSON object of every single country in the world, and their country codes too? Got it! Want an array of states in the United States? Got that too!

## How To Use:
``` JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a very popular format for data transfer, storage and exchange. JSON is used in most computing fields and applications: web development, mobile application development, data science, etc.```

``` To use (consume) JSON, you need to 'parse' it ("parse": "to interprete") according to your language's rules. Provided here are JSON parsing syntax for some of the most popular programming languages. ```

### JavaScript
``` JSON.parse(JSONObject) ```

### Python 
``` import json 
json.loads(JSONObject) ```

### PHP
``` json_decode(JSONObject) ```

### Note
You can simply lookup relevant syntax for your language on sites like StackOverflow and W3Schools
